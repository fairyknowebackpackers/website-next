Multiple private and en-suite room options, dormitory beds for the budget-travelers / larger groups and camping grounds for the star-gazers are all available. Braai facilities, a warm fire-pit and a lively bar are frequently attended along with regular live music, a Sunday market, games evenings and a jungle gym for the kids. Multiple adventures can be booked directly at reception such as kayaking, horse-riding, hiking, paragliding and much more.

## Our Facilities

Fairy Knowe Backpackers has spacious grounds with lawns to play football, a big veggie garden - all surrounded by indigenous forest. The rooms are located away from the entertainment areas so you can have fun while others can get much needed sleep.
